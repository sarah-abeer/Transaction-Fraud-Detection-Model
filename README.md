# Transaction-Fraud-Detection-Model
The Transaction Fraud Detection Model is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify and mitigate fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. By leveraging advanced algorithms and statistical techniques, this model analyzes transaction patterns and flags suspicious activities, helping organizations reduce financial losses and enhance security.
<br>

Features<br>
Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering to prepare transaction data for analysis.<br>
Model Training: Implements various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.<br>
Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.<br>
Visualization: Provides visualizations of data distributions and model performance metrics for better understanding.<br>
Deployment Ready: Contains scripts for model deployment, allowing integration into existing transaction processing systems.<br>
<br>

Prerequisites<br>
Python 3.x<br>
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn<br>
